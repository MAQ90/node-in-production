Here are some of the benefits of Docker containers:

* Allow for rapid application development/deployment
* Allow consistent behavior from dev to production, i.e., portable across machines & environments - fewer bugs!
* Extendable (reuse, collaboration + community)
* Lightweight and fast (no guest OS)
* Easy to collaborate, use and maintain
* Can be versioned and components can be reused
