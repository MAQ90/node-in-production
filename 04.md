# AWS Services for Containers

* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), e.g., Docker image
* Elastic Container Service (ECS)
* Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
* Elastic Beanstalk Containers - PaaS
* [Docker EE for AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06XCFDF9K)
* Relational Database Service (RDS)

---

## Let's cover ECS + ECR usage

1. Create registry
1. Push the app image
1. Create task definition
1. Create cluster
1. Create service

^Task has info about images, env vars and network, cluster is like EC2 instance, service makes sure your containers from task are running in a cluster. ELB and autoscaling group can be added to a service

Successfully created repository, e.g.,

161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/azat-main-repo


---

To install the AWS CLI and Docker and for more information on the steps below, [visit the ECR documentation page](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_GetStarted.html).

1) Retrieve the docker login command that you can use to authenticate your Docker client to your registry:

```
aws ecr get-login --region us-west-2
```

---

2) Run the docker login command that was returned in the previous step. For example,

```
docker login -u AWS -p eyJwYXlsb2FkIjoiQ1pUVnBTSHp
FNE5OSU1IdDhxeEZ3MlNrVTJGMUdBRlAxL1k4MDhRbE5lZ3JUW
...
W5VK01Ja0xQVnFSN3JpaHCJ0eXBlIjoiREFUQV9LRVkifQ==
-e none https://161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

Results:

```
Login Succeeded
```

---


3) Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here. You can skip this step if your image is already built:

```
cd code/banking-api
docker build -t azat-main-repo .
```


---

Build will ends with a similar looking output:

```
Step 13/13 : CMD npm start
 ---> Running in ee5f0fb12a2f
 ---> 91e9122e9bed
Removing intermediate container ee5f0fb12a2f
Successfully built 91e9122e9bed
```


---

4) After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:

```
docker tag azat-main-repo:latest 161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/azat-main-repo:latest
```

(No output)

---

5) Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:

```
docker push 161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/azat-main-repo:latest
```

---

Push output example:

```
The push refers to a repository [161599702702.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/azat-main-repo]

# Main settings for the example

* Two containers: banking-api (private AWS ECR) and mongodb (docker hub)
* Connect to mongodb via network alias
* Map 80 (host) to 3000 (container) for banking-api
* Set env vars for `NODE_ENV` and `DB_URI`

# Dynamic Test

Open in browser with `/accounts`. Most likely the response will be `[]` because the database is empty but that's a good response. The server is working and can connect to the database from a different container.

---

# Static Test

Navigate to http://{PUBLIC_DNS}/node-university-logo.png to see the images with Docker downloaded via `ADD`. You can fetch any data such as HTTPS certificates.

---

# AWS is vast

You should have Elastic Load Balancer, multi-availability zone deployment, Continuos Delivery S3, and managed database services.
